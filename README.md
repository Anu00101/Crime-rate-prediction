# Crime-rate-prediction
As part of a collaborative project team, I primarily focused on the SQL and database-driven analysis aspects of our Crime Rate Prediction project. Working alongside my teammates who concentrated on machine learning and visualization, I ensured that the data foundation for the project was robust, clean, and query-optimized.

My responsibilities included:

Database Design & Structuring: Helped design normalized relational tables to store socio-economic, demographic, and crime-related datasets.

Data Loading & Cleaning: Wrote SQL queries to import raw datasets, handle duplicates, missing values, and ensure consistency across tables.

Exploratory Analysis with SQL: Collaborated with analysts to uncover patternsâ€”such as city-wise crime rates, correlations with unemployment/health indices, and year-on-year comparisons.

Advanced SQL Queries: Implemented aggregate functions, joins, subqueries, and window functions to generate insights required by the ML team.

Collaboration in Feature Engineering: Provided aggregated SQL outputs (like crime rate per 100k population, or socio-economic indexes) that were later fed into the predictive models.

Performance Optimization: Indexed key columns and restructured queries to improve execution time for large datasets.

Team Collaboration: Coordinated closely with data scientists, ensuring they received structured, query-ready datasets for modeling, and validated outputs against SQL-driven ground truths.
